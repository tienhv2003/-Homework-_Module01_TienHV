        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p> The House passed the SAVE Act on July 10 by a bipartisan vote of 221-198, with five election-year vulnerable
        Democrats crossing the aisle to vote with all Republicans. It's unclear whether that same support would carry
        over into Johnson's planed showdown vote over funding the government.</p>

        <p>The Congressional Hispanic Caucus calls the bill "extreme and dangerous" and warns it would purge millions of
        legal voters from state rolls and make it much more difficult for Americans to reregister to vote.</p>

    <div id="t5">
        <h4>Test5</h4>
        <p>When Congress returns to Washington on Monday after summer recess, lawmakers will be staring down a looming
            government shutdown on Sept. 30 when funding is set to run out.</p>

        <p>But before they get down to brass tacks, Republicans and Democrats will face off in an election-year partisan
            battle over voter eligibility.</p>

        <p>During a private phone call with the House Republican Conference on Wednesday, sources told ABC News that
            House
            Speaker Mike Johnson outlined his plan to avert a government shutdown -- rallying House Republicans around a
            short-term government funding bill that extends funding into March 2025 but includes a major policy proposal
            Democrats warn will kill the money bill.</p>

        <p>Sources said Johnson told members that he wants to hold a vote on his short-term funding plan early next week
            --
            although next week's floor schedule has not been officially announced.</p>

        <p>House leaders regularly attach priority items to must-pass stopgap funding bills as a means of pushing
            through
            measures their members demand.</p>

        <p>This will be no different, as Johnson told members. According to sources, he'll attempt to attach the SAVE
            Act
            -- a bill requiring individuals to provide proof of U.S. citizenship to vote -- to the funding bill.</p>
